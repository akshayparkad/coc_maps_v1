                <p>This website started out as a fun side project back in May 2019. Its purpose was to teach me how to program, and it was supposed to be a place for me to store my war base layouts.

                    It went live on June 22nd 2019. After presenting it ingame over the global chatrooms (back when they still were a thing) to players, it gathered a lot of interest, and quickly grew into a much much larger undertaking.
